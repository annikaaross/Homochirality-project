# Homochirality simulation

## Introduction
This project aims to model the behavior of monomers creating polymer chains to explore whether a difference in strength between heterochiral and homochiral bonds tends to naturally produce more homochiral polymers. Because the classic biological molecules are long-chain homochiral polymers, a natural tendency toward homochirality in pre-biotic polymers could have played a role in the origin of life.

## Using the model
This model exists in two forms: one designed to run in Google Colab and one designed to run locally. These versions are independent, but very similar.


### Colab
The files History_reader.ipynb and Homochirality_with_dashboard.ipynb

### Local
The files parser.ipynb, chirality_sim.py, and batch_engine.py
