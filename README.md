This is a project aims to create a model of the effects of homochiral bonds on the overall
chirality of a group of molecules. If homochiral bonds are stronger, will this eventually lead to 
symmetry breaking in the pool. Life is adapted to be homochiral, thus it is beleived that this 
kind of symmetry breaking would be a precursor to the origin of life.
